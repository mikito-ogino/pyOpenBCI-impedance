# pyOpenBCI-impedance
Python implementation of an impedance check program for the OpenBCI Cyton Board. Validated against OpenBCI_GUI with a 5â€“50 Hz bandpass filter, showing almost identical impedance values. Useful for neuroscience, BCI experiments, and electrode quality checks without relying on the GUI.
