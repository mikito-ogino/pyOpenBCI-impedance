# 🐦 Twitter/X Promotion (English)

- “Released a Python implementation of impedance check for the OpenBCI Cyton Board! Matches the GUI results (5–50 Hz bandpass) and makes electrode quality evaluation easier. Repo here 👉 [link] #OpenBCI #BCI #Neurotech”  
- “Want to check electrode impedance on OpenBCI Cyton without the GUI? I built a Python tool that reproduces the same measurements (5–50 Hz bandpass). Open source repo 👉 [link] #EEG #Neurotech”

Would you also like me to prepare a **shorter “Quick Start” version** of the README for GitHub front page (with badges etc.), or do you prefer keeping it research-style and technical?
